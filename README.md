This project presents an analysis of an E-Commerce dataset from Kaggle, which contains
information about online retail transactions. The goal of this analysis is to develop a time
series forecasting model that can accurately predict the total sales volume for future periods.
By leveraging historical sales data, this model aims to optimize inventory levels, labor, and
marketing efforts, ultimately maximizing revenue. The dataset undergoes various pre-
processing tasks, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and feature
engineering. We then compare the performance of SARIMA time series models, optimized
through grid search, to predict monthly sales volumes. Our findings indicate that the SARIMA
model, after hyperparameter optimization, yields the best results based on Mean Squared Error
(MSE) metrics, providing valuable insights for inventory management and marketing strategy
optimization. The results of this analysis provide valuable insights for informed decision-
making in inventory management, staffing, and promotional activities.
